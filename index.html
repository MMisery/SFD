<h1>You're Invited!</h1>

<p>
    Software Freedom Day (SFD) is a worldwide celebration of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS).
    Our goal in this celebration is to educate the worldwide public about the
    benefits of using high quality FOSS in education, in government, at
    home, and in business -- in short, everywhere!
</p>

<p>
    The admission to the event is FREE and open to all enthusiastic people, though
    we suggest a "Pay-What-You-Can" donation to support FreeGeek Chicago and it's
    educational and outreach programming. If you write open source software, use
    free software, or are curious and want to learn about software freedom and
    the FOSS community, come join us for Software Freedom Day!
