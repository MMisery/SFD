Freegeek Chicago's homepage for Software Freedom Day

Currently using [Jekyll](jekyllrb.com) to generate the site.

- After installing Jekyll, `cd` into the SFD directory and type `jekyll serve`.

Deploying is easy. Just run `./deploy <repository-name>` where `<repository-name>` 
is the name you have the remote repo. By convention this would be `upstream`, or for a personal fork
`origin`. Running `git remote show` will display your options.
