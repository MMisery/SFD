        <p>FreeGeek Chicago is an Illinois not-for-profit organization that provides education in practical computing, hands-on job skills training, and an outlet for community service. Through our educational programming, we are able to refurbish used computer systems, parts, and accessories to provide functional computers to volunteers and the general public.</p>
        <p>FreeGeek Chicago is an advocate of Free/Libre culture and technology for the general public. In addition to installing a GNU/Linux OS on every refurbished system, we host our annual Software Freedom Day event to promote Free and Open Source Software use.</p>
        <p>FreeGeek Chicago is also an autonomous, self-sustaining community. We work hard to create a strong participatory community by creating a safe space and welcoming environment for all. FreeGeek <strong>earns its revenue</strong> through thrift store sales, scrap recycling, and numerous small private donations.</p>
